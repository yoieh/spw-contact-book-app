# To run app

Make sure that you have installed [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm?utm_source=house&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=free%20orgs&utm_term=Install%20npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for your system.

I have tested this on windows 10 with

* node -v v8.2.1 and v8.9.0
* npm -v 5.5.1
* yarn -v 1.2.1

With npm:

$ `npm install`

$ `npm start`

With yarn:

$ `yarn install`

$ `yarn start`

## This is to an open issue with karma!
(https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/2735)

I havent got time to get karma to work with me in this project for some reason.. This mean that there are no working unit test and:

$ `npm test`

dose not work.

Did not get e2e or lint to work ether.

I didn't feel like that i should spend more time troubleshooting this issus for now.
